The digital rodent project aims to generate an in-silico model of the mouse and rat functional connectome using open-access fMRI dataset. 

We have curated and aggregated >3000 fMRI scans from mice and rats from ~50 participating [laboratories](./etc/geoplot/geoplot.md). We want to leverage this to generate accurate and representative in-silico models of the rodent functional connectome.

We want to use the normative model framework to create a trans-species framework to compare functional connectome features accross diagnostics
